# ROAD DAMAGE DETECTION SYSTEM

The objective of the project is to fabricate a system and mention the required algorithms to sense the road anomalies by using CNN that can be equipped in any mobile phones that can be fit in car or public transport or any road vehicles. 

Using the CNN algorithm, system is able to identify and classify the road damages and other road anomalies from the acquired data set.

We have developed a dataset of road damage images using the road images captured using an smartphone and in some reliable sites such as Google etc.,

Since this system doesnâ€™t make use of any fancy instruments or drones to detect the damages, this proves to be a simple but efficient solution for this problem.
